# Flask Web Application Deployment with Docker and AWS

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Python Flask web application using Docker for containerization and AWS ECS for hosting the application. The app is pushed to Docker Hub and AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for container management.

## Key Features

- **Dockerized Application**: The app is containerized using Docker, making it portable and easy to deploy.
- **AWS ECS and Fargate**: Deployed the containerized app using AWS ECS with Fargate for serverless compute and scalability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for seamless automation of Docker image building, pushing to Docker Hub, and deploying to AWS.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python, Flask
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS ECS, AWS Fargate, AWS ECR, AWS ELB
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
